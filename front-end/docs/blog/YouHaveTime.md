## The usual

During my very last semester at UCF, spring 2025, I went to pick up a few groceries from a market in Orlando and was about to hit the road to Fort Myers.

I drove back home often. Even though the trip would be 4 hours with I-4's famous traffic, I somewhat enjoyed it. The drives calmed me down. I turned on the music, cruised toward the west, and watched the sun come down over the horizon.

## The random

As I was pushing the cart after loading the trunk, an elderly Asian man got out of his car with his wife. He was standing still and looking at me.

I didn't pay attention (as usual), but I noticed him eventually. He smiled and said, in a very calm tone: "You have time."

I didn't respond; I didn't know how to. I smiled back.

## The after

I thought about that moment till today. I don't know who he was, we never met. But for some reason, he read me, whether it's from my face expression, my behavior, or something else.

It was random, it was special. I have rushed so much, have never been satisfied and have been pushing myself hard. And I still do so today.

Now, I think about those three words with a deep breath when I struggle.
