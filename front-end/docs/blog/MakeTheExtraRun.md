## The Extra Run in Soccer

The Extra Run often means covering your teammate's position. It might or might not change the outcome of the game.
I'm a soccer fan and player. I like to believe that the way I play the game affects the way I live, and vice versa.

I don't like losing a game.
I hate knowing that if I had made that extra run, we might have won.
I don't beat myself up if I tried my absolute best and lost.

## Bruno Fernandes | 8

Bruno is my favorite player in modern soccer. Apart from elite skill and intelligence, the man carries an unmatched energy with him every time he steps on the pitch.
Manchester United has been losing games embarrassingly on and off, yet Bruno still runs, still plays through pain to contribute his best for the club.
He's undoubtedly a United legend, and he won a million hearts with those extra runs.

The rare inspiration I find.
