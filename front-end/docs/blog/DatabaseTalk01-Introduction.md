## Preface

The world runs on a lot of things, things that I argure are no less important than fire to human than what fire was during the stone age. Things that if somehow it turns broken the world will stop functioning.
Database is one of them, it's one of the most significantly innovation of humanity last century. That's how we have digital news, iphone password, photo library, Spotify, etc.
Every single software engineer uses a database of some sort. Sadly, I think not many know how it works. I am one of them. With everything's going on with AI, it's easy neglect learning the fundamentals.
This series of database talk is from my notes attending CMU Database System class.
