# Frontend Technology Specifications

## Overview
Technology stack for the static blog application frontend, designed for optimal performance, developer experience, and maintainability.

## Core Technologies

### Build Tool
- **Vite** - Modern build tool providing fast development server, hot module replacement, and optimized production builds

### Framework
- **Vue.js 3** - Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces with composition API and reactive data binding

### Content Format
- **Markdown** - Content authored in Markdown format with frontmatter metadata
- **markdown-it** - Robust markdown to HTML conversion with built-in highlight.js integration for syntax highlighting
- **gray-matter** - Professional frontmatter parsing supporting YAML, TOML, and JSON metadata formats
- **highlight.js** - Standalone syntax highlighting library integrated with markdown-it

### Styling
- **SASS** - CSS preprocessor for enhanced styling capabilities with variables, mixins, and nested rules
- **Custom CSS Architecture** - Modular SASS organization with abstracts, base, layout, and component styles (Bootstrap not currently implemented)

### Programming Languages
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Primary languages for application logic, component development, and build automation

## Architecture Benefits

- **Performance**: Static generation with Vite optimization delivers sub-2 second load times
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, TypeScript support, and component-based architecture
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with Vue components and SASS modular styling
- **Scalability**: Static output scales infinitely via CDN distribution
