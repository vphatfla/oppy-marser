<h1>Point Cloudfront distribution to EC2 public DNS</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>Minimize the cost of running services on AWS by eliminating the use of elastic IPv4, load balancer, NAT, ...</p>

<p>Every user has 750 hours free of charge when using <em>public ipv4</em> (not elastic), hence, this method might reduce the cost of app hosting when there is no need for Load Balancer and/or NAT.</p>

<p>This is a trick to reduce cost, not a standard/recommended way to host important, secured applications.</p>
